/***** Cave Game *****/

This is a 3D game made for me to learn more on Unity. I used two tutorials from the official Unity website.
  - First the Roll-a-ball : https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial
  - Then the Procedural Cave Generation: https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/procedural-cave-generation-tutorial

I mix them to have a game where you have to collect pick-ups in a procedurally generated cave. 
I choose that each time you collect all the pick-ups, a new map is launched.

I also put some comments (FR) on the code to help me understand everything and use my own textures.

--- OS Compatibility ---
